Dear participant,

 

Thank you for registering for our Travel Survey Workshop.

 

The workshop will be hosted in the Nechako Residence building in the University of British Columbia Okanagan campus. Please find a map attached.

 

For those driving to campus, please park in Lot F. Also note that you will not be able to access parking via Upper Campus Way, nor Alumni Avenue as the former does not connect to Lot F, and the latter is closed for construction.

 

For your convenience, transit routes to the event have been included below:

Vernon, Oyama, and Lake Country: Route 90

Winfield: Route 23

OK College and Rutland: Route 8

Kelowna/West Kelowna: Route 97

 

Alternatively, if you require transport from areas close to the UBCO campus, you can download the Lime app via the following link to find rentable e-scooters and e-bikes near you.
